				<p>This is a hobby project I started on my own in 2020. I wanted to run an 'always up' broadcast.  I did not want to run a GUI application like OBS on my desktop.</p>
                <p>To meet my self imposed requirments I created some micro-services to run on my FreeNAS machine. The micro-services inluding a metadata DB with API server, a python script to play videos, and a discord bot for users to interact with. </p>

            <div class="ui sizer vertical segment">
                <p>I run the DB, metadata API, and Discord bot in a docker-compose network of containers.  The player runs on a seperate Raspberry Pi connected to hardware for streaming video to RTSP services.  The project is still running locally 24/7, but due to bandwidth limits I'm not pushing the video stream to a host such as Twitch/Youtube.  If you'd like to see it in action just contact me.</p>
