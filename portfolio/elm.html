				<p>ELM Notebooks was a group capstone project for for CS464 Principals of Human-Computer Interaction course at CSU. <p>
                <p>My group used a contextual inquiry approach to conduct observations/interviews with laboratory biologists in a real lab setting. We then applied user-centered design techniques to prototype an application meant to improve their workflow by eliminating breakdowns which were identified in the observation/interview stage.</p>
                <p>The following links display some of the work we accomplished.</p>
